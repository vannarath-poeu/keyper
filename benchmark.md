Document:  A new graphical user interface for fast construction of computation phantoms and MCNP calculations : application to calibration of in vivo measurement systems Reports on a new utility for development of computational phantoms for Monte Carlo calculations and data analysis for in vivo measurements of radionuclides deposited in tissues . The individual properties of each worker can be acquired for a rather precise geometric representation of his -LRB- her -RRB- anatomy  which is particularly important for low energy gamma ray emitting sources such as thorium  uranium  plutonium and other actinides . The software enables automatic creation of an MCNP input data file based on scanning data . The utility includes segmentation of images obtained with either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging by distinguishing tissues according to their signal -LRB- brightness -RRB- and specification of the source and detector . In addition  a coupling of individual voxels within the tissue is used to reduce the memory demand and to increase the calculational speed . The utility was tested for low energy emitters in plastic and biological tissues as well as for computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scanning information
